## **So, what is Closer?**

---

An interactive website where youths can bridge the gap with these migrant workers, by appreciating, understanding, helping them feel understood, included, and more. 

In this website, I built an interactive story game called Far Away From Home, a feature of Closer. At Far Away From Home, you will be able to see and experience the daily life of a migrant worker in Singapore, by playing as a character called Kumar. The aim of this game is to allow youths to better understand the lifes of these migrant workers and learn to appreciate their hard work, instead of taking them for granted.

### Below are some screenshots of the project:
